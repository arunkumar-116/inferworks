Content:
Objective: Detect protein expression levels in patient samples.

Step 1: Prepare protein lysates from cell or tissue samples. Quantify protein concentration using Bradford assay.
Step 2: Mix 20µg of protein with loading buffer. Heat at 95°C for 5 minutes.
Step 3: Load samples onto SDS-PAGE gel. Run electrophoresis at 120V until dye front reaches bottom.
Step 4: Transfer proteins to PVDF membrane using semi-dry transfer apparatus.
Step 5: Block membrane with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature.
Step 6: Incubate with primary antibody specific to target protein overnight at 4°C.
Step 7: Wash membrane 3 times with TBST, 5 minutes each.
Step 8: Incubate with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature.
Step 9: Wash membrane 3 times with TBST. Detect protein bands using ECL reagent and image on chemiluminescence system.
Notes: Maintain cold chain for samples. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Record all observations in lab notebook.
